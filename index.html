    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
      Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her
      desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and
      all the other<br />
      scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of
      <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since
      college, and the longer she<br />
      spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under the poster
      with an Oskar Wilde quote proclaiming that
      <q
        >Work is the refuge of peaple who have<br />
        nothing better to do</q
      >. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the sccret of
      the llma <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
      outstading achievement, Molly<br />
      <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
